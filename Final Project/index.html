               <h1 >My Motto</h1> <hr </hr>
       <p>“Not only travel pictures and good-looking recipes are useful photos, in fact, really good pictures bring you a kind
           of feeling. When you are no longer obsessed with catering to the world's standards, you are a photography enthusiast,
           otherwise you are just a person working for a camera manufacturer. So how can you establish your own video standards?
           If the content of the photo is touching, it is enough for you to clearly photograph it.”</p>
